## Overview

<a name="usage"></a>
## Usage

For the time being, these instructions assume that your environment is already prepared for React Native development. Simply clone the repository, install the dependencies, and run the application as usual. For example:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/nuclearpasta/react-native-drax-example.git
$ cd react-native-drax-example
$ yarn
$ cd ios; pod install; cd ..
$ yarn run ios
```

Note that during the build you will see an error like this:
```
error React Native CLI uses autolinking for native dependencies, but the following modules are linked manually:
  - react-native-vector-icons (to unlink run: "react-native unlink react-native-vector-icons")
```

This is expected and will continue until [react-native-vector-icons](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons/) has [full autolinking support](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons/issues/1185). You can ignore the message.
